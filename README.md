# epub-to-frequency-list
This is a simple project testing the functionality of taking an epub, and then getting a frequency list of the words in it based on all lemmatizations and forms of a word. By doing this, for language learners you can easily learn the first 100-200 words of a text for boosted comprehension and an even better learning experience.
